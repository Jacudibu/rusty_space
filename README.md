An economy focused RTS / Space Sandbox written in Rust and Bevy, highly inspired by games such as AI War and the entirety of the X-Series.

Right now things are still very Work-in-Progressy. I'll be more open to contributions once I've figured out more about the general direction this will take, which includes filling [docs](docs) with a proper game design document. :>

### License & Upstreaming of features
While the code is currently licensed under AGPL3.0, if you find anything that might be useful enough to be upstreamed into any of the MIT/Apache2.0 crates we are using, create an issue, and I'll happily support you doing so. The same goes for functionality which could be extracted into external crates in order to be useful for other projects. :)

An economy focused RTS / Space Sandbox written in Rust and Bevy, highly inspired by games such as AI War and the entirety of the X-Series.

Right now things are still very Work-in-Progressy. I'll be more open to contributions once I've figured out more about the general direction this will take, which includes filling [docs](docs) with a proper game design document. :>

If you find anything that might be useful enough to be upstreamed into any of the crates this project is using as dependencies under one of the more permissive licenses, just create an issue and I will gladly support you in doing so! The same goes for generic functionality which could be extracted into external crates with MIT/Apache Dual Licenses to be useful for other projects in the bevy ecosystem. :)

### Contributing

Right now a lot of things are still changing constantly - my vision for this game isn't set in stone yet, and I'm mostly just "following the fun" whilst learning more about rust and bevy. Once things are more ironed out and set in stone, I might get more open to people contributing stuff, but for now... please don't. :')

So technically, at the moment the best way to support development might be reviewing what I got and giving me hints on how I could do better!

/// ### General Idea
/// Every Sector may have asteroids inside it, defined by its [SectorAsteroidData].
/// Every Sector keeps track of its "alive" Asteroids inside their `asteroids` variable.
/// There is a fixed amount of asteroids within each sector.
/// Once an asteroid is mined or floats outside the sector borders, it gets removed from the sectors
/// `asteroid` variable and its visibility is turned off.
/// Another system keeps track of an ordered Queue with all "dead" asteroids, resetting their position
/// and visibility once a set [SimulationTimestamp] has been reached.

 Asteroids are supposed to move very slowly, so this really doesn't need to be checked every frame for every asteroid.

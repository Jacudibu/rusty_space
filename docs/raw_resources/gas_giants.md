# Gas Giants
*Gas Giants consist of multiple layers. The outer layer can easily be harvested just by ships equipped with a modified vacuum cleaner, whereas the middle layer can still be harvested by ships but at less efficiency. Speed is the key here, as only a couple ships can interact with the same planet simultaneously - forming a visible queue in case there are too many ships waiting. Reaching the lower layers requires some construction work. Through these, players can unlock almost infinite yields of the dense gases down there... as long as they invest the necessary resources to extract them.*

As with everything in this folder, this is just a collection of ideas to pick from when actually designing the economy.

## Upper Layers
*Easily accessible even to ships. Can be harvested without meeting any special requirements.*

### Hydrogen
- **Antimatter Production:** Hydrogen can be used as a raw material for antimatter, which could be the most powerful energy source known.
- **Quantum Energy Storage:** Utilized in quantum batteries that store immense amounts of energy in a stable form
- **Fuel:** Generic Fuel source for metal refining

### Helium
- **Stabilization Fields:** Integral to creating fields that stabilize wormholes or other forms of faster-than-light travel.
- **Basic coolant:** Useful for superconducting magnets or cryogenics.
- **Advanced Superfluid Technologies:** Used to create computational systems which operate at near absolute zero.

## Middle Layers
*While these can still be harvested by regular ships, yields are much lower without special equipment.*

### Methane
- **Fuel:** Generic fuel source for metal refining.
- **Hydrocarbons:** Used in the production of plastics and other organic compounds.
- **Synthetic Lifeforms:** Primary energy source for engineered lifeforms designed to operate in extreme environments.
- **Hyper-Efficient Energy Cells:** Provide power to advanced robotic units and personal energy weapons.

### Ammonia
- **Fuel:** Generic fuel source for metal refining.
- **Fertilizer:** Increase yields in food production chains.
- **Life Support Systems:** Theoretically, ammonia-based lifeforms could exist and open up completely different, more fantastical production chains for specific factions.
- **Terraforming Agents:** Employed in the atmosphere of planets to promote the creation of habitable environments, adjusting temperature, and chemical composition

## Lower Layers
*These require special equipment to be accessed. Such equipment could come in the form of a vent-like structure built on the planet.*

### Water Vapors
- **Agriculture:** Hydroponic Farms will be very happy.
- **Starship Biospheres:** Allow long-term human habitation and ecological balance on interstellar voyages.
- **Photon Shields:** Protect against cosmic radiation and projectile impacts by dispersing energy through a dense vapor medium.

### Hydrogen Sulfide
- **Sulfur:** An efficient source of sulfur for industrial processes.
- **Quantum Sensors:** Detect subatomic particles and fluctuations in spacetime, aiding in scientific research and espionage.

## Deep Layers
*Building the structures enabling access to these resources comes at a hefty material cost.*

### Neon
- **Holographic Communication Networks:** Useful for communication, entertainment and training.
- **Exotic Weaponry:** Powers high-energy plasma weapons that can disrupt the molecular bonds of targets.

### Krypton
- **Stealth Technology:** Integral to creating cloaking devices that bend light and radar.
- **Gravity Manipulation Devices:** Enabling artificial gravity in space habitats and the remote manipulation of objects. Weapon systems?

### Xenon
- **Temporal Engines:** Powers engines capable of manipulating time, allowing for limited time travel or time dilation effects, crucial for deep-space exploration and combat scenarios.
- **Interstellar Beacons:** Fuels beacons that send quantum-entangled signals across the galaxy, providing instantaneous communication regardless of distance. Useful for communication, entertainment and training.

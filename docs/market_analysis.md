# X4: Foundations
A Single-Player Space Sandbox. Mostly focused on Economy, but there's also ship commands and combat, but the AI is generally pretty unreliable. Production chains focus on [three different](https://x4prodchart.com/) tiers, but is overall still pretty simple. Ships are mostly built of T3 materials, so starting from scratch is not an option. Bigger / Better ships just require more materials. Each playthrough starts with the same Universe layout, and factions are seeded in the same locations, but from there on, sector ownership slowly changes dynamically over time. Except for the terran faction, everyone uses the same recipes for everything - even faction specific consumables are just the same recipe with different names. In vanilla X4 the AI Economy cannot survive without player intervention; There are shortages everywhere. The game can be modded through a special XML format and the UI doesn't support bigger empires all that well - there is no way to search or group things, it's all just a big list.

### Monetization
One time purchase (50€), yearly DLC Releases (15€ each)

### Inspirations for us
- Universe/Sector Layout (Hexagons connected through gates)
- The map in general. Visually, our game is basically going to be just X4's map screen.
- Station & Trade mechanics
- Shipbuilding

### Main differences to our game
- Our universe will be dynamically created, and factions won't be locked in place.
- We will have highly simplified station building, and stations cannot be walked in.
- Planets can be colonized.
- Asteroids move through a sector instead of just randomly respawning at set places, thus it'll be easy to see how many resources are available.
- Product Tiers will be more relevant, as (bad) ships can already be constructed from T1 ingredients alone. 
- We will have multiplayer
- We will have a tad more automation (eg. stations could be set up to order ships on their own)

# Prosperous Universe
A browser based MMO focused on simulating a player-driven space economy. Basically EVE Online without graphics, with more complicated production chains and no combat whatsoever. The lack of any kind of automation makes more advanced base setups very time and click intensive. It's trying to be extra realistic with ship physics and stuff, and things move veeeery slowly. A single production run can take over a day.

### Monetization
Free to play, but pretty much any bigger setup requires a subscription after a couple of months.<br> 
Additionally, non-paying players get completely deleted after a short inactivity period, which punishes taking breaks.<br>
Subscriptions range between 8€ - 6€ / Month, depending on duration.<br>
Additional Perks (none of which influence gameplay) are available as one-time purchasable "early access tiers".

### Inspirations for us
- Simple Graphics
- Complex production charts

### Main differences to our game
- While multiplayer will be an option, we definitely won't be an MMO.
- Multiple Players can share the same faction in our game.
- Our game will be way faster paced.
- We will have ship combat.

# EVE Online
The mother of all Space Sandbox MMOs, simulating a player driven economy, with varying factions warring over sector ownership. Players can take on a variety of roles, and will passively skill up over time to better fit their chosen niche.

### Monetization
Free to play, more advanced skills and certain trade interactions are locked behind a subscription.<br>
Subscriptions range between 20€ - 11.30€ / Month, depending on duration.<br>
Additionally, cosmetics can be purchased through an in-game shop, as well as faster skill progression and ingame money through the sale of Cash Shop currencies.

### Inspirations for us
- Shipbuilding / Outfitting through modules

### Main differences to our game
- While multiplayer will be an option, we definitely won't be an MMO.
- We will have super simplified graphics. 
- Players control an entire faction, not only a single ship.

# Starsector
Still gotta properly play this one. :>

### Monetization
One time purchase (15€)

### Inspirations for us
TBD

### Main differences to our game
TBD

# AI War
AI War might be the most complex RTS game out there. The AI is truly vicious without cheating, and every playthrough requires different tactics given the available resources. Economy on the other hand is highly simplified - there's Energy and Metal, and that's it. Players control thousands of units, composed of a variety of ships.

### Monetization
AI War I: One Time Purchase (10€), DLCs adding meaningful content expansions for 5€ each.
AI War II: One Time Purchase (20€), DLCs adding meaningful content expansions for 10€ each.

### Inspirations for us
- Graphics of AI War I.
- Ship Variety, which can be translated into ship modules.
- Might attempt something similar with the AI during combat.

### Main differences to our game
- We'll have more of an economy focus, but take some inspiration from the AI & Combat.

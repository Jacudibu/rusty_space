While production plants can work fully automated, even in the distant future it's still better to have someone there to oversee things. Machines never learned to do paperwork properly, after all.

Stations can be expanded with Habitation modules. Those will house a certain amount of workforce, who will then boost production by a set percentage.

## Consumables
Workforce needs consumables to function properly. These depend on the preferences of the individual [races](races.md), but there should always be 2 (?). 

Accordingly, the available workforce slowly increases when the required consumables are available, and decreases if there are shortages.

## Luxury Goods
Luxury goods further boost workforce growth and efficiency, but aren't necessary to run the facility.


# Crews
Ship crews are optional, but give slight bonuses to ships when they are assigned, as well as slowly repairing those ships over time. They can also be used to board ships, in case that ever turns into a feature. Bigger ships can staff more crew at once.

Crew is taken directly from a shipyards' workforce, incentivizing luxury good usage there to keep up with demand in case the shipyard is producing crewed ships non-stop.

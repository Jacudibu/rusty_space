# EVE Online
The mother of all Space Sandbox MMOs, simulating a player driven economy, with varying factions warring over sector ownership. Players can take on a variety of roles, and will passively skill up over time to better fit their chosen niche.

### Monetization
Free to play, more advanced skills and certain trade interactions are locked behind a subscription.<br>
Subscriptions range between 20€ - 11.30€ / Month, depending on duration.<br>
Additionally, cosmetics can be purchased through an in-game shop, as well as faster skill progression and ingame money through the sale of Cash Shop currencies.

### Inspirations for us
- Shipbuilding / Outfitting through modules

### Main differences to our game
- While multiplayer will be an option, we definitely won't be an MMO.
- We will have super simplified graphics.
- Players control an entire faction, not only a single ship.

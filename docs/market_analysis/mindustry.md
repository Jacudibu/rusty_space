# Mindustry
On this list for the way its being development and marketed rather than the gameplay.
It's an open source game, with the latest builds publicly available to everyone over on GitHub and some other distribution platforms.

Despite requiring payment on steam, player numbers according to [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/1127400/charts/#1w) still hit 1k on a daily basis over there. This serves as proof to me that creating an open source game whilst also making some money off of that work is totally possible.

### Monetization
Free to Play (GitHub, Mobile, FlatHub), Pay to Play (10â‚¬ on Steam), "Pay what you want" on itch

# Prosperous Universe
A browser based MMO focused on simulating a player-driven space economy. Basically EVE Online without graphics, with more complicated production chains and no combat whatsoever. The lack of any kind of automation makes more advanced base setups very time and click intensive. It's trying to be extra realistic with ship physics and stuff, and things move veeeery slowly. A single production run can take over a day.

### Monetization
Free to play, but pretty much any bigger setup requires a subscription after a couple of months.<br>
Additionally, non-paying players get completely deleted after a short inactivity period, which punishes taking breaks.<br>
Subscriptions range between 8€ - 6€ / Month, depending on duration.<br>
Additional Perks (none of which influence gameplay) are available as one-time purchasable "early access tiers".

### Inspirations for us
- Simple Graphics
- Complex production charts

### Main differences to our game
- While multiplayer will be an option, we definitely won't be an MMO.
- Multiple Players can share the same faction in our game.
- Our game will be way faster paced.
- We will have ship combat.

# AI War
AI War might be the most complex RTS game out there. The AI is truly vicious without cheating, and every playthrough requires different tactics given the available resources. Economy on the other hand is highly simplified - there's Energy and Metal, and that's it. Players control thousands of units, composed of a variety of ships.

### Monetization
AI War I: One Time Purchase (10€), DLCs adding meaningful content expansions for 5€ each.
AI War II: One Time Purchase (20€), DLCs adding meaningful content expansions for 10€ each.

### Inspirations for us
- Graphics of AI War I.
- The massive amount of ships
- Ship Variety, which can be translated into ship modules.
- Might attempt something similar with the AI during combat.

### Main differences to our game
- We'll have way more of an economy focus
- The AI Factions won't be as big and all-powerful. The player will be on equal terms.

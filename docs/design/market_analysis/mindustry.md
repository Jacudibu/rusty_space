# Mindustry
On this list for the way its being developed and marketed rather than the gameplay: It's an [open source game](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry), licensed under GPL-3.0. 

The latest builds are publicly available to everyone over on [GitHub](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/releases) and some other application distribution platforms.

Despite requiring payment on steam, player numbers according to [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/app/1127400/charts/#1w) still hit 1k on a daily basis over there. This serves as proof to me that creating an open source game whilst also making some money off of that work is totally possible.

### Monetization

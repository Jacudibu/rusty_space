The game world is spread out across a hexagonal grid. Every single one of those cells represents a sector.
Boundaries between sectors cannot be directly crossed, units need to pass through gates within the sectors in order to initiate a sector transition through hyperspace. There are fewer gates than sector edges - which means that some sectors might only be reached through certain paths, forming natural hubs and choke points. There might be bigger, visual gaps on the map in order to separate sectors which aren't easily reached from one another through a direct gate path. 

Some sectors might be completely empty (except for a single gate leading elsewhere), others might host busy asteroid fields or solar systems. Either are useful for players: providing either a comparatively safe, empty building space or valuable resources to fuel such a spot.  

### Sector Ownership
A sector can be claimed by a faction. This will be represented visually by differently colored edges. 
Ownership doesn't directly change anything mechanics wise, but factions will be more inclined to keep hostile units outside their owned sectors. Some factions might already view it as a hostile action to just claim a sector right next to them, leading to interesting border conflicts.

Sectors are neutral by default. But that's boring! So how do we claim them and what do we get in return?

Sector ownership in general is useful for AI navigation, as ships can easily avoid hostile sectors without needing to check what's inside.
Besides that, colored sector borders in the respective faction color is mostly a visual effect.

# Analysis: How do other Games manage Sector Ownership?
### X4: Sector Claim Modules
Setup: Stations contain administration modules.
Action: The first faction to build one of those modules owns the sector. 
Reward: ??? I don't think there's any direct advantage besides being able to police said sector

Downsides: Transferring Sectors in a peaceful way is not possible.

### Screeps: Dump resources into Control Nodes
Setup: Most Sectors hold a Controller. 
Action: A creep has to be ordered to move to that controller and actively increase a claim timer.
Reward: Claiming a sector doubles the resources inside.

### EVE
Setup: Territorial Claim Units & Infrastructure Hubs
Action: TCUs/IHubs need to be built in a system and regularly provided with resources
Reward: TCUs lower fuel consumption of stations in that system, IHubs allow all kinds of sector upgrades (Jump Beacons / Jammers, allowing Capital Shipyards, More Ore & Anomalies)

### AI War
Setup: Build one of multiple Command Stations
Action: The building needs to be built
Reward: Depending on the built station, the sector will have different buffs. Military stations are way bulkier too.


# Claiming Sectors should not be free.
I like the idea that laying claims to a sector comes with a reoccurring cost, as that keeps the economy busy.
Optionally paying more for a greater reward is a very juicy idea as well. Could also somewhat exponentially increase the cost based on the size of the stations owned in that system to give people yet another reason to expand.

## Potential Rewards
- Other factions cannot claim a sector while it is already claimed. It must first be forced into a neutral state.
- Increase the amount of ore found in asteroids
- Buff friendly ships

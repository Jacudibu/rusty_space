# Races 
> Disclaimer: These are a very low priority as of right now.

If we implement them, Races should matter.
They should not just come with skins or flavor texts, but actually feel or play different in some way.

That means some of their production chains should be partially different to others, and their ships (and maybe their modules) should be differently balanced, maybe even have a specific module that's unique to them. Crew could yield different bonuses.

The tech of other races can be acquired by analyzing ship and station wreckages. Multiple wreckages as well as a lot of other resources might be required to fully figure out advanced technology. Alternatively, in a peaceful universe, blueprints can just be purchased for a load of money.

## Humans
Boring, **Carbon+Water**-based creatures. You already know them well enough, and for the sake of simplicity, they'll definitely be the default until there's time for more. Consumables are focused around Water and Hydroponics, luxury goods focus around... ~~alcohol and other drugs~~ ...?

- Consumables involve water and plants. Water can be harvested from ice-asteroids or deep gas giant layers and cultivated on "earth-like" planets or hydroponics.
- Luxury goods revolve around Alcohol and other drugs, lol. They are relatively easy to produce. 
- Ships and components are fairly average. Why are humans always the 'balanced average' in games?

## Avali
A prime candidate for a **Carbon+Ammonia**-based life form. Bird-Raptor hybrids from space!

- Consumables involve ammonia and plants, which can be harvested on Gas Giants and cultivated on ice planets or hydroponics.
- Luxury goods revolve around electronic gadgets and augmentations, more complicated to produce than those of other races.
- Ships and components are more expensive, especially at higher tiers. Heavy focus on quality over quantity - they come with better base stats and maybe even extra module slots.

## Something stone-based
A **Regolith-based** life form. Moving stones.

- Consumables involve a healthy mix of stones and metals, mostly acquired from asteroids.
- Luxury goods revolve around Gems and Crystals, hidden beneath the surface of terrestrials.
- Their ships are slower, but very bulky, with a good amount of cargo capacity.

## AI Zerg
A **sentient AI**, controlling its own zerg swarm in an attempt to gather more energy for its computation. What happened to its original creators is unknown, but now it's sitting in front of your doorstep and wants to acquire more energy cells.

- Only one consumable: Energy. Lots of it. Workforce mechanic is either completely skipped at the cost of higher energy costs for recipes, or robots are still a "Habitation" module that only requires energy as consumable.
- No luxury goods. 
- Ships and components are rather cheap. Since the AI got no pilot lives to worry about, it focuses on quantity over quality. Since their ships lack a cockpit or crew, they cannot be boarded.

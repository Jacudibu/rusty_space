# Terrestrial Planets
*Planets which are mainly composed of rock and metal and have at least semi-solid surfaces may serve as a mid- to lategame resource source. They are rarer than asteroids and require a heavy resource investment to exploit them. Similarly to gas giants, they can serve as a near infinite source of materials in the late game.*

# Asteroids

*For the sake of simplicity, every asteroid only contains one specific ore, but sectors might have multiple types of
asteroid inside them. Asteroids float through the sector, spawning at one edge and moving slowly to the other, at which
point they despawn and respawn after a set interval. Fully mining an asteroid will also make it despawn, although it
will respawn at the same time and position it would have done if it wasn't harvested. This means the total amount of
asteroids / minerals available per sector is limited, which should become noticeable during the late-mid game, where sectors might be immediately cleared of any asteroids starting to float through them.*

Scientifically, Asteroids can be classified into 3 overarching Types: C, M and S. Would be fun if we could have all
three of them to some degree.

## C-Type Asteroids (Cabonaceous)

### Water / Ice:
- **Life Support Systems:** Self-explanatory for water-based lifeforms.
- **Hydroponic Farming:** A highly reliable source of food.
- **Electrolysis:** Reliable source of Hydrogen and Oxygen.
- **Terraforming:** Essential for transforming arid planets into habitable environments.
- **Fusion Power:** Used as a source of deuterium, providing a virtually limitless energy supply.
- **Cryogenic Stasis:** Useful for long-duration space travel.

### Organic Compounds:
- **Pharmaceuticals:** Drugs to sustain rough working environments and fight disease.
- **Bioprinting:** Printing synthetic organs and biological tissues for medical use and enhancement.
- **Nanoengineering:** Creating self-repairing materials and smart fabrics with embedded organic nanotechnology.

## M-Type Asteroids (Metallic)

### Platinum-Group Metals (PGMS â€“ Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium & Friends):
- **Catalysts:** Generally used in production processes involving chemical reactions.
- **High-Efficiency fuel cells:** Used to produce engine parts and improve energy cell production.
- **Advanced Electronics:** Used to coat electrodes and to manufacture optical fibres and LCDs.
- **Antimatter Containment:** Used as a highly potent energy source.
  
### Gold
- **Advanced electronics:** Very nice conductive properties.
- **Energy Shields:** Protect against cosmic radiation and physical attacks.
- **Luxury Items:** Could be used to attract workforce or make said workforce happy.

### Cobalt
- **Superalloy Armor:** Starships and exosuits which provide superior protection and durability.
- **High-Capacity Batteries:** Could boost energy cell production.

## S-Type Asteroids (Silicaceous)

### Silicon
- **Solar Panels:** Passive energy production, yay!
- **Chip Manufacturing:** Wafers would be used in pretty much any kind of "smart" device.
- **Quantum Computing:** Building ultra-fast quantum computers that revolutionize data processing and AI.
- **Holographic Displays:** Useful for communication, entertainment and training.

### Nickel / Iron
- **Structural Components:** Spaceship & Station Hulls
- **Tools:** Nuts and bolts.
- **Space Elevators:** Main ingredient to allow easy transport of materials and people to and from planetary surfaces.
- **Megastructures:** Main ingredient for colossal space habitats, orbital rings, and Dyson spheres.

## Other
### Rare Earth Elements (REEs):
- **Advanced Electronics:** Yet another potential critical ingredient for those.
- **Graviton Manipulation:** Enabling artificial gravity in habitats and advanced propulsion systems.
- **Stealth Technology:** Rendering objects invisible or undetectable by bending light in specific ways.

### Regolith:
- **Radiation Shielding:** Thick walls around habitats to protect inhabitants from cosmic and solar radiation.
- Could also be a waste product when processing or compressing raw asteroid ore.

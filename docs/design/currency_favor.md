Money in a space age is a weird concept. That's why I want to try out something different.

## Favor
> You scratch our backs, we scratch yours.

I'd call it quite literally **Favor**.
It's still a numerical value which technically works mostly just like money, but the concept is a little different, as it's also combined with faction standing.

As such, favor is faction specific.

#### Just like money, you will
- Receive Favor for selling goods to a faction.
- Pay (or lose) Favor for buying goods from a faction.
- Be rewarded with favor if you attack enemies of this faction (basically like bounties)

#### Unlike money, you will
- Lose favor when you attack the faction.
- Lose favor when you attack friends of the faction.
- Lose favor when scheduled shipments are delayed.
  - This is probably the most interesting point, as it also affects other factions. You could sow distrust between two factions by raiding their transport ships.

You require a certain amount of favor to be able to trade with a faction.

## Perception
Suddenly being liked less by someone just because you bought a bunch of stuff from them is weird. That's why there's a secondary attribute we'll call **Perception**. As long as you don't do anything bad, Perception is the maximum favor you've ever gained with a faction, and used for your public standing with that faction.

Doing "Bad things" decrease both your Favor and Perception, however, your Perception will be affected more heavily the bigger the difference to your current favor is.

So if you just purchased *a lot* of super expensive goods and then blow up the station producing said goods, the faction will immediately recognize this as high-level sabotage. Similarly, if you are high on favor and do a little whoopsiedoodle by assaulting their allies, the faction will be more lenient with you.

## Open Questions
- How is this supposed to work in multiplayer with different player factions?

# RTS Progression
Players will progress in tiers as the stuff they manufacture becomes more and more complex.
Should probably turn these into some diagrams to make them easier to read.

Players start in a random sector. The sectors near to these starting positions have both Ore and Silicon Asteroids and a sun orbited by a gas giant and another (random) planet.

## T0: Natural Resources
These can be harvested from Asteroids, Gas Giants, and Planets with varying difficulties. See [raw_resources](raw_resources) for a collection of options.

### T1: Pure Scrap
*Serving as an introductory tier, the recipes here are very uncomplicated, and the required ingredients are available in abundance across the universe.*

**T1 Ships** are cheap, and they perform like one would expect: A hunk of scrap, merely held together by some duct-tape. The fact that they are somewhat capable of space travel is a miracle. Don't expect them to last long in any kind of fight.

##### Random Examples:
Ore -> **Refined Metals**

Silicon -> **Silicon Wafers**

Refined Metals + Silicon Wafers -> **T1 Ships**. 

Refined Metals + Silicon -> Makeshift Solar Panels attached to a station -> **Energy Cells**

Any flammable Gas + Silicon -> **Energy Cells**

### T2: Electricity
*Recipes require more ingredients or an additional production Step; Most notably energy cells which can be acquired in a variety of ways. Overall, all the required raw materials should still be available in one way or another, only requiring minimal expansion from one's starting position.*

**T2 Ships** are more efficient than T1 ships in every regard, and should be able to completely replace them, unless someone goes for a play style focused entirely on quantity.

##### Random Examples:
Silicon Wafers + Energy Cells -> **Electronic Circuits**

Methane + Energy Cells -> **Graphite** + Energy Cells -> **Graphene**

Refined Metals + Electronic Circuits + Graphene -> **T2 Ships**

Energy Cells + ??? -> Simple Shield Components

Energy Cells + ??? -> Simple Weapon Components

-> Now we can build small fighter-class ships!

### T3: Advanced Materials
*Stuff gets more complicated, requiring rarer ingredients alongside intermediary goods from previous tiers. Players and factions will have to adjust their ships and production steps to their environment - either by sacrificing certain components such as higher level shields, trading for the required materials or expanding aggressively to secure a steady supply of their own at the risk of hostile reactions.*

**T3 Ships** would include destroyers and carriers, as well as advanced fighters.
These, alongside T2 Ship equipped with T3 modules, would be considered the "gold standard" for advanced factions.

##### Random Examples:
Graphene + ??? + Energy Cells -> **Carbon Nanotubes**

Electronic Circuits + Carbon Nanotubes -> **Advanced Circuits**

Advanced Circuits + Refined Metals + Carbon Nanotubes -> **Smart Plating**

### T4: Specialized Components
*Being able to produce anything in T4 should give the player or faction a significant advantage in that specific field. Alongside the T3 and T2 ingredients, necessary raw resources are spread thinly across the universe, only available to one or two factions without trade.*

**T4 Ships... don't exist.** But the T4 Modules can be equipped to T2 and T3 hulls, sacrificing quantity over quality or sprinkling some quality into the masses.
